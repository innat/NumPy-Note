**NumPy** is a core-library for scientific computing in Python which provides high performance multidimentional array objects as well as concern tools or attributes for working on these array objects. 

Numerical Python or NumPy for short is one of the most foundational packages for numerical computing in Python. In fact, most advanced computational packages providing scientific functionality use it's array objects.

In these notebook-tutorial following contents will be covered.
